# Logistic Regression - A Sentiment Analysis Case Study

This project-based course from Coursera as a part of the guided project.
Here we will learn the fundamentals of sentiment analysis, and build a logistic regression model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. 
We will use the popular IMDB data set. Our goal is to use a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn for document classification.
